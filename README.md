# Power BI Sales Dashboard – DEPI 🚀

This repository contains my **first interactive Power BI dashboard**, built as part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** training program.

## 🔑 Key Highlights:
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and transformed sales data using Power Query (duplicates removed, missing values handled, fields standardized).
- **Data Modeling**: Star schema model with one Fact table (Sales) and multiple Dimension tables (Date, Product, Region, Channel, Sales Rep).
- **KPIs (DAX)**:
  - Total Sales vs. Target
  - MTD (Month-to-Date) Sales & Achievement %
  - YTD (Year-to-Date) Sales & Achievement %
  - YoY (Year-over-Year) performance vs. Target
- **Visualizations**:
  - Overview with KPIs and variance analysis
  - Product & Category performance
  - Regional & Sales Rep analysis
  - Trends (monthly & yearly vs. target)
- **Extra Features**:
  - Home page for navigation
  - Drill-through pages for deep analysis
  - Slicer sync & bookmarks for better UX
